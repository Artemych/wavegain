- Bugfix: percentages sometimes show > 100% done
- Bugfix: investigate calculated RG gain when --gain and DC correction is used,
   also how these are affected by --limiter, --noclip, etc
- Fix --help linux issues (copyright at bottom, * ? as Wildcard)
   if possible, make it convertable to nroff (man page) and/or html (manual),
   so the 3 are always in sync
- Standard license/copyright headers in all sources
